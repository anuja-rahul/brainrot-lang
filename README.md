# Experimenting with Brainrot languages

Welcome to my experimental project repository! In this project I mess around with the Python pre-processor `Pygyat` and the C-based `Brainrot language`, just for fun and learning. (and any other brainrot language I can find)

## Project Structure

- **pygyat-projects**: This part of the project uses the Pygyat library and explore it's functionalities.
- **brainrot-projects**: This part includes the Brainrot language implementations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12** or higher
- **C Compiler** (like `gcc`)
- **Make** (for building C projects)
- [**Brainrot interpreter**](https://github.com/araujo88/brainrot) (for interpreting brainrot files)
- [**Pygyat preprocessor**](https://github.com/shamith09/pygyat) (to process pygyat files)

### Setting Up Python Environment

1. **Clone this repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anuja-rahul/brainrot-lang.git
    cd brainrot-lang
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    cd pygyat-projects
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Pygyat**:
    ```bash
    pip install pygyat
    ```

### Building the Brainrot Compiler

- **Visit brainrot language documentation**:

    - [brainrot documentation](https://github.com/araujo88/brainrot)

### Running Your Code

- **For Python scripts**:

    ```bash
    pygyat your_script.pygyat
    ```

    - [pygyat documentation](https://pygyat.vercel.app/docs)

- **For Brainrot programs**:

    ```bash
    ./brainrot < your_program.brainrot
    ```
